# Trackora (by DigiReps)

Trackora (by DigiReps) is a comprehensive time and productivity tracking solution designed for modern teams. It combines a powerful desktop monitoring client, a feature-rich admin portal, and a robust backend integration with Supabase.

## Architecture

The project is divided into three main components:

- **Desktop Client (Root)**: An Electron-based application that runs in the background to track user activity, take screenshots, and monitor application/URL usage.
- **Admin Portal (`/admin-portal`)**: A React-based web interface for managers to oversee projects, members, budgets, and detailed productivity reports.
- **Backend (`/backend`)**: An Express server that handles data aggregation, member invitations, and complex business logic, sitting on top of a Supabase database.
